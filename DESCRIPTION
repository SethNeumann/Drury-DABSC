A revised version of Dennis Drury's Dual ABS Signal Controller

Dennis used to build these himself but has moved on to Arduino based alternatives
however there is a market for people who don't want micro controllers.  This revision
brings the design into my parts master and reduces the parts count.
- replace the 6 discrete resistors with a DIP pack (I used 1K resistors so this is just 6
resistors in a pack --actually 7 1 isn't used
- replace the axial cap with a radial to conform to my parts master and save some space
- Use ground and power planes to simplify layout and add distributed capacitance
